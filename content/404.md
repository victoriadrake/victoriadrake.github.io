title: "404"

## Why wasn't this page found?

We asked some leading software developers.

**Agile Development**  
The page was in the backlog, but we prioritized something else for this sprint.

**Waterfall Model**  
The page wasn't found because it wasn't scheduled in the current phase. Check back after we finish design, implementation, and testing.

**Continuous Integration**  
This page is probably broken because the last merge went straight to production without proper testing.

**DevOps**  
Our infrastructure automated the deployment of this page, but it seems like the server didn't get the memo.

**Object-Oriented Programming**  
The page object was never instantiated, so it doesn't actually exist.

**Functional Programming**  
The function to generate this page was pure, but the side effects of showing it were too risky.

**Microservices**  
One of the 18 services needed to render this page failed. We're not sure which one, but we're working on it.

**REST API**  
The endpoint you're trying to reach returned a 404 because the resource was never created.

**Machine Learning**  
Our model predicted you'd want this page, but the accuracy was only 50%. Sorry, wrong prediction.

**Scrum**  
The team discussed this page during the daily stand-up, but then we got sidetracked by a blocker and forgot about it.

**Version Control**  
This page exists, but it's stuck in a branch that was never merged. It’s living its best life in the forgotten recesses of our repo.

**Technical Debt**  
This page might have existed once, but it was removed to pay down some technical debt. We didn’t think anyone would notice.

**Unit Testing**  
We tested every other page, except this one. Guess we missed a case.

**Full Stack Developer**  
This page was halfway done, but then the front-end and back-end teams couldn't agree on the API format, so it never made it.

**Legacy Code**  
This page was written in a language no one on the team knows how to debug, so we just left it alone.

**UX Design**  
We redesigned the website, and now no one can find anything—including this page. But hey, doesn't it look sleek?

**Code Review**  
This page failed the review process. The code was spaghetti, so we just scrapped it.
