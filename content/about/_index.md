Hello! I'm Victoria Drake. Here's what I do.

## Leadership

I love leading tech teams to deliver great software with a focus on security and maintainability. With my background as a principal software engineer, I'm able to find improvements in every area of building excellent software, from process to production.

## Software and Security

I serve as a core maintainer and co-author of the [Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)](https://owasp.org/) [Web Security Testing Guide](https://github.com/OWASP/wstg).

In my free time, I love building software and giving it away. You can find out more about my open-source work at [github.com/victoriadrake](https://github.com/victoriadrake).

## The Next Generation

I'm on a mission to help prepare millions of new engineers to take on the next era of technology.

I earned the annual Top Contributor award from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) for three consecutive years. I was also recognized two years in a row as a Distinguished Author on the [DEV.to](https://dev.to/victoria) developer platform. And I've written for multiple business and software engineering publications across the web as well as [here on my blog](/blog).
