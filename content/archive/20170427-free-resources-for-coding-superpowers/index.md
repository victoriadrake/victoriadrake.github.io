I'm frequently asked for my opinion on how to get started with being a freelance developer. If you're hoping to live the life of a remote working digital nomad, whichever career you choose, having a little coding expertise in your back pocket will be a big benefit.

Here's a quick list of resources that you should definitely look at first if you're hoping to gain some coding superpowers for free.

## freeCodeCamp ({{< extlink text="freecodecamp.org" href="https://freecodecamp.org/" >}})

**An amazingly high value curriculum that can take you from zero to full-stack.** This is always my top recommendation for someone looking to test the waters and see if a development career is interesting enough to pursue. The toughest part about learning to code on your own is getting stuck and not having quick help - this is the problem that I think freeCodeCamp (fCC) solves best by allowing you to immerse yourself in a hugely supportive social community. Through their forum, you can get quick advice if you get stuck on a challenge, and even team up with someone to tackle projects in-depth. The fCC community is lively and diverse with people from all over the world, and many local chapters even host regular meetups.

## HackerRank ({{< extlink text="hackerrank.com" href="https://www.hackerrank.com/" >}})

**Solve challenges tailored for every level of coder over a variety of relevant topics. Enter competitions and increase your chances of getting hired.** I love HackerRank especially for its algorithm and statistics challenges - if you're hoping to get into data science, this is an area that you'll need to be especially sharp in. Seasoned developers return to HackerRank to hone their skills and enter competitions that can win you swag and get you noticed for jobs.

## Stack Overflow ({{< extlink text="stackoverflow.com/" href="https://stackoverflow.com/" >}})

**Even seasoned developers have questions.** This is the top search hit that comes up when you Google that error message you thought only you were getting. If you're shy about asking a question you can't find the answer to - don't be! Simply asking it will be of help to the next person who comes looking for the exact same solution.

## The Odin Project ({{< extlink text="theodinproject.com/" href="http://www.theodinproject.com/" >}})

**A curriculum for web developers built on a collection of resources designed to take you from "What's the Internet?" to web dev hire.** For those specifically interested in web development, there's a community here for you. The Odin Project (TOP) has plenty of tutorials and practice projects to flesh out your knowledge of web dev essentials.
