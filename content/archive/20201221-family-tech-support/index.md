ðŸŽ„ðŸŒŸ Happy holidays! ðŸŒŸðŸŽ„

For those of you seeing relatives this season, chances are that youâ€™re the designated family tech support. If part of your time home for the holidays is spent on software updates and troubleshooting WiFi, here are a few other quick wins to help boost your family's online privacy and security.

## 1. Set up a VPN

Using a VPN is Online Safety 101. Choose a reputable provider with a strict no-logging policy, or if you're up for it, [roll your own](/blog/set-up-a-pi-hole-vpn-on-an-aws-lightsail-instance/).

## 2. Introduce a password manager

If your family member uses the same password everywhere (`<petname>`+`<house number>`, same as last year) because passwords are hard to remember, introduce them to their new best friend, [1Password](https://1password.com/). Help your family get set up with secure passwords they don't have to write down on Post-It notes -- just one master pass(phrase) is all you need.

When choosing a passphrase, avoid using information easily found on social media accounts, like pet names, favorite sports teams, favorite brands, or birthdays.

## 3. Switch to DuckDuckGo

Help fight the Internet search monopoly by getting your family to use a search engine that respects their privacy. Go to your browser **Settings** and set your **Default Search Engine** (that uses the URL bar) to [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/). Break the ice with an instant answer feature, like searching "calendar" so you can [count down to Christmas](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Countdown+To+25th+dec+2020&t=canonical&ia=answer).

(You might want to search for "classic cocktails cheat sheet" after all this.)

## 4. Install a better browser and blocker

While I prefer a [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/), setting one up can be complex. Instead, help set up a privacy-preserving browser like [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) or a wide-spectrum blocking extension like [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) [(GitHub source)](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock).

Your family will get faster page load times, less advertisements interrupting articles and videos, and fewer sneaky trackers leaking browsing habits to big tech, all with near-zero maintenance.

## Be a home-for-the-holidays hero!

Help improve your family's security posture this holiday season. A little beefed-up cybersecurity may be one of the best gifts you can give!
