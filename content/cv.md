## Engineering Director and Principal Software Engineer

As a seasoned engineering leader, I guide teams to produce secure, industry-leading software for both government and private sector entities. My unique experience equips me to navigate the full spectrum of technology product development, from roadmap conception to final deployment and operations.

I've excelled as an engineering director, principal software engineer, and mentor. I connect executive decisions with hands-on technical experience. I enjoy sharing my expertise at many levels, whether it's advising C-suite executives on technology strategy or software and security best practices, unblocking development teams, or deep-diving the codebase with developers to tackle complex architectural and technical challenges. I particularly thrive in leading distributed teams and bringing together complementary skills.

I'm a co-author of the OWASP Web Security Testing Guide and advocate for cybersecurity training across organizations. Along with contributions to various business and engineering publications, my track record reflects my commitment to understanding the technology and security terrain and ensuring teams can traverse it with confidence.
