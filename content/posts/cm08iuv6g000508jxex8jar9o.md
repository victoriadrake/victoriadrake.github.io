**The more you advance towards leadership in your tech career, the less technical your focus becomes.**

The most helpful things you can do become less about any particular technology or architectural problem and more about how to enable your leaders and team members to solve them.

Here are the most critical things technical leaders can do for their teams.

### 1\. Delegate Responsibility

Trust your team members. Instead of fixing bugs or implementing features yourself, assign these tasks to the right people. This empowers your team and frees you to focus on larger challenges.

**Concrete Suggestions:**

* **Assign Ownership:** For major initiatives, assign clear ownership to team members. For example, if your team is migrating to a new framework, delegate the project lead role to someone who shows interest and capability. Encourage them to make decisions and involve them in strategic discussions.
    
* **Set Expectations:** When delegating tasks, clearly outline the expected outcomes and deadlines, but give them the autonomy to decide how to achieve those goals.
    
* **Provide Support:** Check in periodically to see if they need guidance or resources, but avoid micromanaging. This balance helps them grow while ensuring project success.
    

### 2\. Foster a Learning Culture

Encourage continuous learning. Provide access to online courses, workshops, or conferences. If a team member is interested in a new programming language, support them. This could lead to innovative solutions in the future.

**Concrete Suggestions:**

* **Learning Stipends:** Offer a yearly learning stipend for your team members to spend on courses, books, or conferences. This demonstrates your commitment to their growth.
    
* **Internal Knowledge Sharing:** Organize regular “lunch and learn” sessions where team members can share what they’ve learned or are passionate about. This promotes peer learning and creates an open, curious environment.
    
* **Hackathons:** Host internal hackathons or innovation days where team members can work on projects outside their regular responsibilities. This can be a fun way to explore new technologies and foster collaboration.
    

### 3\. Focus on Communication

Clear communication is crucial. Regularly share the team’s goals and how each person’s work contributes. This can be done through weekly team meetings or one-on-one check-ins.

**Concrete Suggestions:**

* **Set Up Communication Channels:** Use tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams to keep communication flowing. Create channels for project updates, general discussions, and specific technical topics.
    
* **Regular Updates:** Send a weekly email or Slack message summarizing key achievements, upcoming deadlines, and any changes in direction. This keeps everyone aligned and reduces misunderstandings.
    
* **One-on-One Meetings:** Schedule regular one-on-ones with your team members. Use these meetings to discuss their progress, any concerns they have, and how they feel about their workload and career development.
    

### 4\. Develop Leadership in Others

Identify potential leaders in your team and mentor them. Pair them with experienced members on challenging projects or let them lead meetings. This helps build a strong pipeline of future leaders.

**Concrete Suggestions:**

* **Mentorship Program:** Create a formal or informal mentorship program within your team. Pair junior engineers with senior ones to help them navigate challenges and develop leadership skills.
    
* **Leadership Opportunities:** Offer opportunities for potential leaders to take charge, whether it’s leading a small project, facilitating a team meeting, or representing the team in cross-department discussions.
    
* **Feedback Loops:** Provide constructive feedback to help them refine their leadership abilities. Highlight what they’re doing well and offer guidance on areas for improvement.
    

### 5\. Remove Roadblocks

Look for and eliminate obstacles that slow your team down. This could involve negotiating for more resources, improving tools, or streamlining processes.

**Concrete Suggestions:**

* **Identify Bottlenecks:** Regularly review your team’s workflow to spot inefficiencies. For example, if your deployment process is taking too long, consider investing in better CI/CD tools.
    
* **Cross-Department Collaboration:** If your team is waiting on another department (e.g., for approvals or resources), facilitate conversations between teams to speed up the process.
    
* **Empower Problem Solvers:** Encourage team members to flag any blockers they encounter. Create an environment where people feel comfortable raising issues without fear of blame, and prioritize fixing these roadblocks swiftly.
